        <h2>About Me.</h2>
        <p>I was first introduced to graphic design through a high-school photography class. As someone who enjoys dabbling in different artistic mediums, the idea of being able to use those varied skills appeals to me. As a graphic design student I can now see the world in a different light, understanding how different disciplines come together to create a final product.</p>
        <p>The realization that hobbies like painting and photography all have a place in graphic design is what truly drives my passion for the work I do.</p>
        <p>The photography and illustrations in the moodboard are all my work.</p>
